       <h1>Commercial invoice</h1>
       <h3>
        A commercial invoice (like the one shown Figure 15-1) is the first international document that you’ll prepare as an exporter. It provides details that
        are included in many of the other documents.
        The commercial invoice serves as a bill for the goods from the importer to the
        exporter, and it also serves as evidence of a transaction. Additionally, the
        importer uses the commercial invoice to classify the merchandise, so that he
        can get the shipment cleared expeditiously through Customs and make sure
        that all duties and taxes have been accurately assessed.
        A commercial invoice must include all the following required information:
         Complete name, address, and phone for both the exporter and consignee
        (the person actually receiving the shipment)
        The consignee is usually the importer, but the importer could have the
        goods shipped to another address or individual. The consignee is the
        person or company named in the contract as the person or company
        that the goods are being turned over to.
         Terms of sale (see Chapter 13)
         Reason for export
         A complete description of the item:
        • What is the item?
        • What materials is the item made of?
        • What is the item used for?
         Harmonized Tariff Codes, if known (This information is used by Customs
        to determine applicable duties and clearance requirements.)
         Country of origin (where manufactured) for each commodity
         Number of units, unit value, and total value (purchase price, in whatever
        currency the quote was made) of each item (If your shipment is just a
        sample shipment or one that has no commercial value, you still must
        state a nominal or fair market value on the commercial invoice.)
         Number of packages and total weight (in both pounds and kilograms)
         Shipper’s signature and date
         Consular invoice for exports
         In some instances, certain countries require a consular invoice to control and
         identify goods. Consular invoices are normally purchased from the consulate
         of the country to which the goods are being shipped and usually have to be
         prepared in the language of that country. They also need to be signed by a
         representative of the importer’s country at that country’s embassy or consulate located in the United States. The consul charges a fee for this service.
         You can get information about consular invoices and whether they’re required
         in your particular situation by talking to your freight forwarder. You can also
         determine if there is a specific consular invoice required for any country by
         going to www.export.gov, clicking on I Want To on the right-hand side of
         the page, clicking on Find Country Information, clicking on Trade Information
         Center–Country Database, selecting the region, and selecting the country.
         Shipper’s letter of instructions
         The shipper’s letter of instructions (like the one shown in Figure 15-2) is a
         letter from the shipper/exporter instructing the freight forwarder how and
         where to send the shipment. The information provided in this form enables
         the freight forwarder to process the shipment and prepare the required documentation. The information you provide on the form outlines the details of
         the agreement between the exporter and the importer for the specific sale.
         <h1> bill of lading</h1> 
         A bill of lading is a contract between the owner of the goods (normally the
         exporter) and the carrier of the goods. There are two types of bills of lading:
          A non-negotiable straight bill of lading: The straight bill of lading is
         issued by the exporter. It pertains to the shipment of the cargo from
         the point of origin to the port of shipment. This document serves as
         evidence that the shipping carrier has received the goods and will be
         transporting them to the destination listed on the document.
         nspection certificate
         Some importers and foreign countries may require that the goods be inspected
         by an independent inspection company prior to shipment. The purpose of
         the inspection is to attest that goods are what you’re specifying they are.
         Inspection certificates are issued by and obtained from the independent testing
         organization.
         Dock and warehouse receipt for exports
         The dock and warehouse receipt is a receipt to transfer accountability after
         the goods have been delivered by the domestic carrier to the port of shipment and left with the international carrier (vessel or airplane) for export. In
         other words, this is the receipt issued by the international shipping company
         after the goods have been delivered by the ground carrier to the dock.
         If you work with a freight forwarder, he’ll prepare the dock receipt. When the
         goods are delivered, the receipt is signed by the shipping company and
         returned to the freight forwarder, who then returns the receipt to the
         exporter with the documentation and the freight forwarder’s invoice for his
         services.
         Shipper’s export declaration for exports
         The shipper’s export declaration (see Figure 15-5) is a form used by the
         Department of Commerce to control exports and compile trade statistics.
         The exporter must prepare and submit this form to the Customs agent for
         shipments by mail valued at more than $500 and for shipments by any other
         means valued at more than $2,500. It’s required regardless of value for any
         shipments being made under a validated export license
         Packing list
         The packing list (like the one at www.unzco.com/basicguide/figure7.
         html) is a document that lists the material found in each package. It indicates
          The type of package
          The net weight (the actual weight of the goods)
          The legal weight (the weight of the goods plus any immediate wrappings
         that are sold with the goods)
          The tare weight (the weight of a container and/or packing materials without the weight of the goods it contains)
          The gross weight (the full weight of the shipment, including goods and
         packaging)
          The package’s measurements (length, width, and height)
         It also shows the references (buyer’s purchase order number and seller’s
         order/invoice number) assigned by the buyer and seller.</h3>
