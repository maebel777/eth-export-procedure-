        <h1> Quotations and Pro Forma Invoices </h1>
        
        <h3>Many international inquiries begin with a request for quotation, and the preferred form that an exporter uses to submit a
             quotation is referred to as a pro forma
              invoice, which is a quotation in invoice format. 
              Pro
              forma invoices are used by importers when applying for an import license,
              arranging for financing, or applying for a letter of credit.
              The quotation on the pro forma invoice form should include the following:
              Names and addresses of the exporter (seller) and importer (buyer)
              Any reference numbers Listing and description of products
              Itemized list of prices for each individual item being sold
              Net and gross shipping weights (using metric units when appropriate)
              Dimensions for all packages (total cubic volume, again using metric unit
             when appropriate)
              Any potential discounts
              Destination delivery point
              Terms of sale
              Terms of payment
              Shipping and insurance costs (if required)
              Expiration date for the quotation
              Total to be paid by the importer
              Estimated shipping date
              Currency of sale
              Statement certifying that the information found on this pro forma
             invoice is true and correct
              Statement that provides the country of origin of the goods
             The pro forma invoice must be clearly marked pro forma invoice. If a specific
             price is being guaranteed, the period during which the offer remains valid
             must be clearly stated. Also, the quotation should clearly state that prices are
             subject to change without notice. For example, increases in fuel costs may
             cause unanticipated increases in freight rates on the part of the carriers.

        <h1>Setting the Terms of Sale</h1>
        <h3>In any sales agreement, you need to provide not only the price but also a corresponding term of sale. Terms of sale are the conditions of sale that clarify
            who is responsible for what expenses, as the goods move from the seller to
            the buyer. Terms of sale are an area of concern for many businesses that are
            just beginning to export, because international terms of sale can differ from
            those used in domestic sales.Incoterms, the universal
            trade terminology developed by the International Chamber of Commerce
            (ICC).These terms were created to describe the responsibilities of the
            exporter and importer in international trade. Understanding and using these
            terms correctly are important, because any misunderstanding may prevent
            you from living up to your contractual obligations and make you accountable
            for shipping expenses that you had initially intended to avoid.The terms in international business transactions often sound similar to those
            used in domestic business, but they can have very different meanings.
            Confusion over terms of sale can often result in either a loss of a sale or a loss
            on a sale. So make sure you know the meaning of the terms you’re using.
             Cost and freight (C&F): Cost and freight means that the exporter is
            responsible for all costs and freight expenses necessary to bring the cargo
            to the destination named in the shipping term. The importer would then
            simply be responsible for any unloading charges, Customs clearance fees,
            and inland freight expenses as the cargo moves from the pier to the
            importer’s warehouse. Title (risk of loss or damage) is transferred from
            the exporter to the importer as the goods pass the ship’s rail in the port
            of shipment.
             Cost, insurance, and freight (CIF): Cost, insurance, and freight is similar
            to C&F (see the preceding bullet) with the exception that the exporter is
            responsible for procuring marine cargo insurance against loss or damage
            as the goods are transported from the point of origin to the point of
            destination.
            Chapter 13: Making the Sale: Pricing, Quotes, and Shipping Terms 169
            20
             Delivered duty paid (DDP): Delivered duty paid, followed by the words
            naming the importer’s premises, means that the price includes all
            expenses as the cargo moves from the seller’s factory to the buyer’s
            warehouse. With this term, the exporter bears the full cost and risk
            involved in moving the cargo from the factory to the destination.
            This term represents the maximum obligation for the exporter.
             Ex-quay: Ex-quay means that the exporter is required to make the goods
            available to the importer on the quay (wharf or pier) at the destination
            named in the sales contract. At that point, title transfers from the
            exporter to the importer.
             Ex-works (EXW): The term ex-works means that the exporter’s only
            responsibility is to make the good available at the edge of the loading
            dock of its facility. For a price quoted using this term, the exporter is not
            responsible for the loading of the good onto a truck provided by the
            importer, unless doing so is otherwise agreed to. The importer bears the
            full cost and risk involved in moving the cargo from the factory to the
            destination. EXW represents the minimum obligation for the exporter.
            Whenever, you provide the EXW term of sales, all expenses in moving
            the cargo from the point of origin to the destination is the responsibility
            of the importer. The additional costs could include transportation of the
            cargo to the point of shipment, loading charges, ocean or air freight
            charges, unloading at the destination, Customs fees, and inland transportation expenses to the destination. These charges will either go forward and be collected by the carrier at the destination, or they can be
            additional charges added to the invoice.
             Free alongside ship (FAS): Free alongside ship is the term used to indicate that the exporter is responsible for all expenses as the goods are
            transported from the factory to edge of the ship’s loading dock. Any
            expenses beyond that point are the responsibility of the importer.
             Free on board (FOB): Free on board is the term used to indicate that the
            exporter is responsible for all expenses as the cargo is transported to
            the pier and then loaded onto the vessel at the point of shipment named
            in the sales contract. Any expenses beyond that point are the responsibility of the importer.
             Free on board (FOB) airport: Under free on board airport, the exporter
            is responsible for all expenses in transporting the cargo from the factory
            to the carrier at the airport of departure, and risk of loss or damage is
            transferred from the exporter to the importer when the goods have been
            delivered to the carrier. Any additional expenses from the airport to the
            destination are the responsibility of the importer.

        <h1>Methods of payment</h1>
        <h3>Looking at the Main Forms of Payment
            and Analyzing Their Risks
            Any international transaction involves risk. You need to understand what
            those risks are and what actions you can take to minimize them. The primary
            payments used in international transactions are
             Cash in advance: This means that the exporter will receive his money in
            advance of making the shipment.
             Letter of credit drawn at sight: This is a document issued by the
            importer’s bank guaranteeing that the exporter will get paid, just as long
            as he presents required documents to the bank before an expiration date.
             Time letter of credit: This is the same as the letter of credit drawn at
            sight except that the exporter will get the money a certain number of
            days after the documents have been presented and accepted.
             Bill of exchange (documentary collections): This is like buying something using cash on delivery (COD) except the importer makes the payment when the required documents are presented, instead of when the
            goods are received. There are two types of bills of exchange:
            • Sight draft documents against payment: The importer pays when
            the documents are presented.
            • Sight draft documents against acceptance: The importer makes the
            payment a certain number of days after he has accepted the
            documents.
             Open account: With this method, no bank is involved in the transaction.
            The exporter sends the documents to the importer and trusts that the
            importer will send him the money.
             Consignment: The exporter ships the goods, and the importer only has
            to remit payment for them after the goods have been sold and the
            importer gets paid from his customer.</h3>
